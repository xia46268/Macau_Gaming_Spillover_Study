## Abstract
This study examines the spillover effects of the gaming industry's growth on other industries in Macau, such as wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, and hotels. The study finds that the MICE and cultural industries partially mediate this relationship. The results suggest that policymakers and industry stakeholders should formulate urban economic steering plans to accelerate positive externalities in the gaming industry for sustainable development. Future research could include field experiments, sufficient time data to investigate threshold effects, and the incorporation of urban development variables.

**Keywords**: Gaming industry, spillover effects, Macau, MICE industry, cultural industry, sustainable development, field experiments, threshold effects, urban development.

## Literature Review

### Spillover Effect
Spillover effects, which stem from research on retail space optimization, refer to how one store’s sales can impact another’s. For instance, when shoppers visit multiple stores in a mall to save time, spillover effects are believed to occur.

### Development of Macau’s Casino Gaming Industry
Macau’s casino industry has gone through three stages of development, leading to sustainability issues such as social and environmental consequences and an increasing need for labor. Various studies identify the obstacles Macau faces in exploring diversified entertainment and achieving sustainable development.

## Hypotheses

**H1**: The gross profit growth of Macau’s gaming industry has a spillover effect on the value added of its total industries of wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, and hotels.  

**H2**: The gross profit growth of the gaming industry in Macau contributes to the increase in the output of the wholesale and retail, restaurant, and hotel industries through the MICE and cultural industries as mediating variables.

## Methodology

### Variable Description
- **Dependent Variable**: Value added of wholesale & retail, restaurant, and hotel industries (ASRHI)
- **Independent Variable**: Logarithmic growth rate of gaming industry gross profit (lnggi)
- **Mediating Variable**: Value added of cultural and MICE industries (ACMI)
- **Control Variables**: One-period lag values for cross-border traffic flow and employment-population growth rate.

### Regression Models
Empirical tests were conducted using multiple regression models and mediation analysis to explore the hypotheses.

## Conclusion
This study provides evidence that the gaming industry’s growth in Macau has a positive spillover effect on other industries such as wholesale and retail trade, restaurants, and hotels. Moreover, the study finds that the MICE and cultural industries partially mediate the relationship between gaming industry growth and the value added of these industries.
